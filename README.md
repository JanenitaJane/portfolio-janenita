# Wine Quality Analysis (Pivot Table & Chart)

This project explores the relationship between wine quality and alcohol content using Excel.

## Summary
- Dataset: Wine Quality (Red)
- Tools Used: Microsoft Excel (Pivot Table, Chart)

- Group 6 (highest quality in dataset) had the highest alcohol content.

## Files
- Excel File: “winequality-red.xlsx”
- Pivot Table: Average alcohol per group
- Line Chart: Visual trend of alcohol vs quality
